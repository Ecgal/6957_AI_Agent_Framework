2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - - Look for any floating banners on the webpage that might obstruct the "Add to Cart" button or be misleading the user. If found, close the floating banner with the close button (usually an 'X' in the top right corner) before proceeding to the next action step.

2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - If you still cannot locate the "Add to Cart" button or encounter difficulties due to a potential floating banner:
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - - Perform a SCROLL UP operation to move upwards on the webpage by half of the window height, which may reveal additional elements that could lead to the "Add to Cart" action.
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - 
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - Once you've performed the appropriate CLICK or SCROLL UP operation to access the "Add to Cart" button, continue with the next action step:
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - - After adding the product to the cart, proceed to the cart by performing a CLICK on the shopping cart icon (usually located in the top right corner of the webpage). If this is not possible, try using the menu or navigation links to access the cart.

2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - If you still cannot access the cart:
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - - Check for any login prompts or floating banners that might obstruct your progress. Close them if needed by using the close button (usually an 'X' in the top right corner).
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - 
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - If the issue persists after trying different actions:
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - - Take a break to review the layout of the webpage and other possible interactions before deciding on the next action step.
2025-09-06 17:17:52,300 - - If you believe that a termination is necessary due to the current state of the page, consider providing more details about the issue at hand or requesting further clarification from the user.
