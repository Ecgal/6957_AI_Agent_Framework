2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 -  Based on the current state of the task, it appears that the user is trying to click on a product to add it to the cart but is encountering difficulties due to an advertisement banner blocking the pointer events. Since this issue is preventing the desired action (clicking on the product), the next logical step would be:
2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 - 
2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 - 1. Click on the "X" button or the "NO THANKS" link in the floating advertisement banner to close it, if there is a close button or a "NO THANKS" option within reach. If there isn't one, try an alternative action like:
2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 -    - PRESS ESCAPE (to exit out of the current action)
2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 -    - SCROLL DOWN (to move below the banner and potentially clear any obstacles)
2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 -    - WAIT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND RETRY THE CLICK ACTION LATER (to allow any animations or other actions to complete)
2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 - 2. Once the advertisement is closed, attempt the initial action again:
2025-09-07 18:26:35,360 -    - CLICK on alt="Classic Over-Ear Headphones" with value 'None' (or any other valid locator that resolves to the product element). This should now be possible without interference from the banner.
